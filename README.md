# Species Distribution Mapper

An app that uses the `pygbif` library to get occurrence data and displays a map with the occurrences while also showing relevant information of the species, like countries where it has been seen and its longitude-latitude ranges.

## TODO:
* Evaluate whether to save occurrence to the machine when executing a search so as to have the full csv of the occurrence data
* Find out if the `pygbif` API occurrence response has a citable part in it
* ~~Add scrollwheel to information panel in case a species is cosmopolitan~~
